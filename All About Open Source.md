All About Open Source
With so many open source programs and the buzz going around,let's find out what it is all about

Open Source Programs are programs that offer individuals with the ability to access,modify and contribute to the source code which is open and accessible by everyone worldwide.A contradiction to the corporate world and the proprietary softwares which are kept private from individuals outside of the organisation.
Think of it as a book where everyone and anyone who wishes to write is welcome!

Remember our book example,now we will start adding the necessary details and guidelines every writer must adhere to. 
Now you would not want anyone to write irrelevant information or break the protocol by following a different format or using harsh language.
There are some basic guidelines and steps that every individual must adhere and not violate whatsoever.These guidelines are mentioned in the readme file making its uper easy and convenient.

So,how to do I access the code you ask,well, it is stored remotely on Github and accessed using Git and Github tools and commands.
As scary as these words sound,it starts becoming easy as soon as you start working on it.The Github documentation covers everything and if you are still doubtful you mentors will be there to save the day.

Mentors are guides who help you resolve any issue related to a project,whether you're stuck while code or just a newbie finding your way into cloning and forking repositories,they are the ones to look out for.

Now, you may ask what are the benefits of contributing to Open Source when I can just write mine and work on it,well,there's more to it.Let's look at some of the skills you will gain during the cohorts.
    > COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION - Working in open source communities will help you develop both as an individual and team contributor.You will explore the world of working with new and creative people whilst learning how to code. This is also boost your communication skills as you will be able to understand and communicate your problems and solutions. 

   > OPEN SOURCE TOOLS - The world of Open Source makes everything very transparent,and recording every version of the code that has been written,meaning you can work on previous versions as well and modiy them as per the requirement and demand of the project.

   > COMMUNITY BUILDING - Irrespective of technical or other qualifications you are welcome to contribute to the community and build connections with like minded people.

   > REVIEW AND FEEDBACK - Participating in code reviews helps individuals learn to analyze and improve code written by others.It also builds an environment where individuals provide and receive constructive feeback on ideas proposed and/or code written by them. 

The process of contribution is as follows:
    > STEP 1: Register for an Open Source Program on the official website and select projects to work on
    > STEP 2: Join necessary social media channels for communication 
    > STEP 3: Find or create a new issue and get it assigned to you.
    > STEP 4: Now fork and clone the repository on your device and set the environment necssary for the application to run
    > STEP 5: Create a new branch and start working on the assigned issue
    > STEP 6: Commit and push your changes and open a pull requestso that your code can be merged with the main branch.
    > STEP 7: Wait for feedback and once resolved your pull request will be merged. 
    > STEP 8: Continue contributing similarly!

Here a some of the most amazing Open Source Programs to look out for:
    >Google Summer of Code(GSoC)
    >Hacktober Fest 
    >MLH Fellowship
    >Outreachy
    >Social Winter of Code(SWOC)
    >GirlScript Winter of Code(GWoC)
    >GirlScript Summer of Code(GSSoC)
    
Hope this was helpful and Happy Contributing!
